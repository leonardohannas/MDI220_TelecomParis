# MDI220 Statistics Project: Daily Electric Power Consumption in France

This project analyzes the daily electric power consumption in France from 2013 to 2023, focusing on statistical modeling, parameter estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment, Bayesian statistics, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.

## Topics Covered

### Parameter Estimation:
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution.
- Demonstrating unbiasedness of estimators.
- Applying MLE to real-world data (daily power consumption).

### Goodness of Fit:
- Assessing the suitability of the Gaussian model using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
- Quantifying the dissimilarity between real data and the Gaussian model using a custom metric.
- Comparing the model fit for different regions and seasons.

### Bayesian Statistics:
- Incorporating prior knowledge using a Gaussian prior distribution for the mean.
- Deriving the posterior distribution for the mean.
- Comparing Bayesian estimates with MLE estimates.

### Hypothesis Testing:
- Testing hypotheses about the standard deviation and mean using statistical tests.
- Applying Chi-squared test for variance and Student's t-test for mean.
- Interpreting test results and drawing conclusions.

### Testing Independence:
- Investigating the independence of power consumption between two regions.
- Visualizing the joint distribution using Seaborn.
- Applying a Chi-squared test for independence.

### Confidence Intervals:
- Constructing confidence intervals for the mean power consumption.
- Interpreting confidence intervals and their implications.
